# running, so a stale (or missing) bundle never blocks service startup.  Previously
# this was an ExecStartPre in tinyagentos.service, which added ~50 s to every
# restart after a git pull, and the mtime check could fire spuriously after a
# checkout/rebase even when nothing changed (taOS #807).
#
# The script is designed to be run from the install directory (WorkingDirectory=),
# matching the paths the old ExecStartPre used.

set -euo pipefail

# The service unit sets WorkingDirectory to the install root, so relative
# paths resolve correctly without needing a parameter.
