#!/bin/bash
# Triggers taOS graceful shutdown via HTTP. Used by systemd stop/pre-shutdown hooks.
# Succeeds even if the API is unreachable so we don't block system reboot.
#
# --max-time is deliberately short: this runs on every `systemctl restart`, and
# if /api/system/prepare-shutdown ever hangs (it has), a long timeout strands the
# service in `deactivating` with the port dead for minutes — which also makes the
# in-app Update appear to fail, since it restarts the service. Draining must be
# best-effort and quick; anything slower belongs in an async background task.
#
# Honour the configured controller port: systemd passes TAOS_PORT into this
# hook's environment (see install-server.sh), so a custom-port install drains
# the right origin instead of a hardcoded 6969 that would silently no-op.
#
# Dedupe: both the unit ExecStop and taos-pre-shutdown.service call this script
# on a reboot. Write a stamp on success so a second invocation within 60s is
# a no-op, avoiding a double agent prepare-shutdown pass.
#
# The stamp is a kill switch, so it has to live where only this service can
# write it. It used to fall back to /tmp whenever /run was unwritable (that is,
# on every non-root install), and /tmp is world-writable: the sticky bit blocks
# deleting another user's file, not creating one. Any local user could plant the
# stamp, keep it fresh from cron, and permanently suppress the drain — silently,
# because the script believes a sibling invocation already stamped. On hardware
# with this filesystem's writeback history, skipping the drain is the worst
# available failure. Candidate directories, best first:
#   1. $RUNTIME_DIRECTORY — set by systemd from RuntimeDirectory=taos (0750):
#      /run/taos for the system unit, $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/taos for the user unit.
#   2. /run/taos — the same directory when the reboot hook runs outside the
#      unit; RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes keeps it across a restart.
#   3. $TAOS_INSTALL_DIR/data — the no-systemd nohup install; already 0700.
#   4. the checkout's data/ — when the script is run straight out of a source tree.
# If none of them qualifies we drop the dedupe and drain twice rather than trust
# a stamp anyone could have written.

# Portable (no GNU-only `stat`): a directory we can write into that neither the
# group nor other users can write to.
#
# ls -ld appends a trailing `+` to the mode string when the entry carries a
# POSIX ACL (systemd's RuntimeDirectoryMode does not strip a pre-existing one,
# and some hardening profiles set default ACLs on /run), so a directory whose
# numeric mode is 0750 can still grant write to a group or "other" through an
# ACL entry the plain mode bits don't show -- it would render as
# `drwxr-x---+` here. We reject any `+`-marked mode outright rather than
# shelling out to `getfacl` to inspect which grants: that binary isn't
# guaranteed installed on every target (minimal container/embedded images in
# particular), and a missing-binary failure here must not silently fall
# through to a worse default. This is coarser than strictly necessary -- a
# directory with only a restrictive ACL is rejected too -- but a false
# negative on this check is the CWE-732 DoS; a false positive just means the
# candidate loop drains twice, which the script already tolerates. If a
# platform is known to set default ACLs on RuntimeDirectory, the durable fix
# is still at the installer/systemd-unit level, not detected here.
